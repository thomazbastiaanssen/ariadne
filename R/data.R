#' Dataset of butyrate producers
#' 
#' \code{butyrate} is derived from two observational, population-based
#' microbiome studies on the associations between butyrate-producing gut
#' bacteria and the risk of hospitalisation due to infectious diseases. It
#' provides a set of butyrate producers that were significantly increased or
#' reduced in the patient group.
#' 
#' @format
#' A `data.frame` with 16 features (rows) characterised across 6 taxonomic
#' ranks (columns). One feature was identified at the Species level, whereas all
#' the others at the Genus level.
