Title: On-demand annotation and mapping for module analysis
Description:
    ariadne aims to provide a rapid and robust approach to incorporate taxonomic
    and functional module analyses into your bioinformatic workflow. Despite
    the presence of specialised bioinformatic tools, on-demand functional
    annotation of taxonomic features directly in R has remained challenging. To
    make this simple, ariadne offers tools to rapidly annotate features with
    taxonomic or functional modules based on online resources (BugSigDB,
    ChocoPhlAn, Web of Life and UniProt). In addition, we provide tools to
    incorporate, analyse and visualise module information into popular
    standardised containers, such as TreeSummarizedExperiment.
