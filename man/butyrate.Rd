\description{
\code{butyrate} is derived from two observational, population-based
microbiome studies on the associations between butyrate-producing gut
bacteria and the risk of hospitalisation due to infectious diseases. It
provides a set of butyrate producers that were significantly increased or
reduced in the patient group.
